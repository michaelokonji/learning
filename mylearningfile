this is our file
that i am going to use and understand what is happening
to learn what is happening
the change that i made in local repo
change made on remote repo
so, as learning with git continues on this new day
i will continue to learn how to use git to make and update remote changes
so i am going to add this line so that when i pull/fetch it will call conflicts
now i am trying to learn how to resolve divergence
i think i know why the stash thing is not working
