 this is our file
that i am going to use and understand what is happening
to learn what is happening
the change that i made in local repo
change made on remote repo
so, as learning with git continues on this new day
i will continue to learn how to use git to make and update remote changes
so i am going to add this line so that when i pull/fetch it will call conflicts
now i am trying to learn how to resolve divergence
i think i know why the stash thing is not working
again this is the line that i am ading to practice stashing
so as we continur this learning in asaba nigeria, stashing continues to be an important function to learn
therefore let us now stash something and see if what we can recall what we learned in the airport at atlanta
now on dev branch trying this thing all over again
